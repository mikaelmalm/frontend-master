## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge itself was to try and replicate the designs as good as possible, with the hover/active states on each element that needed one.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Nothing new really learned, but I feel like I had forgotten how to do some things. One prime example is setting the height of the webpage like this (long my prefered way since I remember having safari/IE issues with VH in the past):

```css
html {
  min-height: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  height: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

Working with component librarys for a long time, I felt like my grip of styling with regular CSS was getting loose. I thought I had a good grip on margins and structure, but I got some work to do on those parts.
